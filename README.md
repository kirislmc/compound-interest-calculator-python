# compound-interest-calculator-python

## About the Project
This is a simple compound interest calcaulator for Python. I created this as a part of my learning journey for Python (inspired by [**BroCode**](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez))

## how it works
The Programm asks for principle, rate, time
Validates the input (no negative numbers or letters)
Calculates the total balance using the compound interest formula
Displays the final amount formatted as currency
